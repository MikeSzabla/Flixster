# Unit 1 - *Flixster*

**Flixster** is an android app that allows users to view the currently playing films.

Submitted by: **Michal Szabla**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API. (10 points)

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode. (2 points)
* [ ] Display a nice default placeholder graphic for each image during loading (read more about Glide). If you're running your app on an emulator, you can change the network speed of the emulator to test this feature by following the guidance here. (1 point)
* [x] Improve the user interface through styling and coloring (1 to 5 points depending on the difficulty of UI improvements)
* [ ] For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones. (2 points)

## Notes

Understanding and implementing the recycler view was the most challenging and time consuming portion of the assignment,
but the provided CodePath videos were a great resource that I will definitely be referring back to in the future.
